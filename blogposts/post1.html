            <h2>From Spreadsheets to Software</h2>
            <p>Nine months ago, I took the leap from finance and accounting into the world of full-stack software engineering. I signed up for 
               <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly‚Äôs Software Engineering Bootcamp</a>, not fully knowing what I was getting myself into‚Äîbut let me tell you, it was one of the 
               <strong>hardest, most rewarding experiences</strong> of my life.</p>

            <p>Before this, my days were filled with <strong>balance sheets, Excel formulas, and financial audits</strong>. Now? I‚Äôm writing Python scripts, building React applications, and talking about API integrations like it‚Äôs my second language. It still blows my mind how much can change in less than a year!</p>

            <h2>Bootcamp Life: A Rollercoaster of Emotions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>üíª <strong>Learning to Learn</strong> ‚Äì Coding isn‚Äôt about memorization; it‚Äôs about problem-solving and debugging.</li>
                <li>‚òï <strong>Surviving on Coffee & Late Nights</strong> ‚Äì Daily standups, lectures, and projects meant Stork cold brew became my best friend, and I was known on a first name basis at my local coffee shop "Shagaf".</li>
                <li>üë©‚Äçüíª <strong>Impostor Syndrome is Real (But Temporary)</strong> ‚Äì The first months were tough, but building my own projects changed everything.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Real-World Projects</h2>
            <p>One of the things I loved about General Assembly was how <strong>hands-on</strong> it was. By the end of the program, I had built <strong>multiple full-stack applications</strong> from scratch, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ A <strong>personalized library app</strong> to track my reading progress</li>
                <li>‚úÖ A <strong>skincare products review page</strong> with a classmate</li>
                <li>‚úÖ A <strong>recipie saving app</strong> using Django & React</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
            <p>Graduating from General Assembly isn‚Äôt the finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs just the beginning. Now, I‚Äôm <strong>actively job hunting</strong> for my first full-time role as a software engineer. It‚Äôs exciting, nerve-wracking, and honestly a little surreal.</p>
            <p>If you‚Äôre thinking about transitioning into tech, I <strong>highly recommend</strong> checking out 
               <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>. It‚Äôs a life-changing experience, especially if you‚Äôre willing to <strong>put in the work</strong> and push through the tough moments.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <blockquote>
                ‚ú® <strong>You are capable of learning anything.</strong> ‚ú®
            </blockquote>
            <p>Seriously, tech can feel intimidating, but <strong>everyone starts somewhere</strong>. If I can go from finance to full-stack development in under a year, <strong>so can you</strong>.</p>

            <p>Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have some job applications to send out‚Ä¶ and probably another cup of coffee to drink. ‚òï</p>
